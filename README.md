## Usage

```clojure
(use 'erdos.clojure)
```

Testing basic types
```clojure
(inspect [nil :a-keyword 'a-symbool])
(inspect [{:a 1 :b 2 :c 2}
          #{:a :b :c}
          [[1 2] [3 4] [4 5 6]]])
(inspect (int-array [1 2 3 4 5]))
```

Some Java collections
```clojure
(inspect (new java.util.HashMap {:a 1 :b 2}))
(inspect (new java.util.ArrayList [1 2 3 4]))
```

A lazy chunked seq
```clojure
(inspect (map inc [1 2 3 4 5]))
```
An infinite lazy seq
```clojure
(inspect (map * (range) (range)))
```

Change of the atom is shown real time.
```clojure
(def a (atom 1))
(inspect ["speed:" a])
(swap! a inc) ;; execute this several times in a row.
```
